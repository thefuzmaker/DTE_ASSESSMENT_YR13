        Young Vinnies is the Youth Arm of the St Vincent De Paul Society who are active worldwide in support of those who are in need, regardless of colour, creed or race. It has been operating since it was reintroduced successfully into the College in 2014. It has continued to thrive and  year upon year produces members and Leaders who are motivated by and continue to ensure that by their actions "Charity will fulfill the Law".

Rosmini's Young Vinnies are required to do 20 hours of service before they receive their badges. They are able to do this through the following Ministries that we have operating within the College. Once badged they must continue to be actively involved in the Ministries of their choice and consider a Leadership role if it is offered.
